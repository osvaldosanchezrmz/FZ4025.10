AMD,Groq’s founder on why AI’s next big shift isn’t about Nvidia,"You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. The race to better compete with AI chip darling Nvidia (NVDA) is well underway. Enter Groq (GROQ.PVT). The company makes what it calls language processing units (LPUs). These LPUs are designed to make large language models run faster and more efficiently, unlike Nvidia GPUs that target training models. Groq’s last capital raise was in August 2024, when it raised $640 million from the likes of BlackRock (BLK) and Cisco (CSCO). The company’s valuation at the time stood at $2.8 billion, a fraction of Nvidia’s more than $3 trillion market cap. It currently clocks in at $3.5 billion, according to Yahoo Finance private markets data. At the helm of Groq is founder and CEO Jonathan Ross. While at Google (GOOG), Ross designed the custom chips that the tech giant would go on to train its AI models on. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Ross to discuss his future plans for Groq. Ross is fresh off a trip with other key tech executives to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump in forging a deeper tech relationship with the country. Ross begins by sharing with Sozzi the conversations he had on the ground in Saudi Arabia. For full episodes of Opening Bid, listen on your favorite podcast platform or watch on our website.

CSX,"CSX CEO: The US economy is growing, but slowly","You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. There is arguably no better economic indicator than following demand trends from the largest railroad operators in the United States. Railroads, such as Warren Buffett-owned Burlington Northern and rivals Union Pacific (UNP) and CSX (CSX), haul everything from car parts to steel to coal to food. Therefore, whether the economy is doing badly or well is often captured in the top and bottom lines of railroads, more so than in wonky, backward-looking economic data from the government. With tariffs from the Trump administration starting to weigh on the economy, investors would be wise to check in on railroad operating performance. That’s just what the Yahoo team has done. Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with CSX Corp.'s Joe Hinrichs to discuss current business trends amid the Trump tariff war. Hinrichs has a very unique view of the tariff situation, as he was a long-time top executive at Ford tasked with running its global operations. Are railroads predicting a recession? Does Trump’s ‘Made in America’ focus spell opportunity for railroads long-term? Sozzi and Hinrichs dig in!

DOC,How the 10-year yield affects REITs,"Interest rate-sensitive REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) are set to benefit from the Federal Reserve's anticipated easing of monetary policy. Richard Anderson, Wedbush managing director of equity research for REITs, joins Catalysts to provide insights into this segment of the market. Anderson observes an ""instant gratification"" scenario unfolding in REITs, noting their quick recovery despite the weaker state of the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX). He explains that ""any kind of investment vehicle with an income component like the REITs"" tends to thrive in a declining rate environment. However, he raises questions about the longer-term outlook, wondering, ""What does a better rate environment, a normal sloping yield curve, do to people's attention of the fundamentals of commercial real estate?"" describing this as ""the next leg of opportunity"" for the sector. Anderson points out that uncertainty within the 10-year yield curve affects REITs' ability to deploy capital and grow earnings. He emphasizes, ""The real thing that we're watching is the longer end of the curve. And if we get some certainty there, then it's perhaps off to the races, and perhaps we'll have an outperformance here in 2024 from the REITs.""
