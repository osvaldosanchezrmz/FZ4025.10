        "### 3️⃣ In what situations would using a different dimensionality reduction method (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP) be preferable over PCA for visualization of embeddings?\n",
        "\n",
        "I used PCA in the notebook to reduce dimensions to 2D and visualize clusters. It works well when the main structure is linear. But if the data has more complex or curved patterns, t-SNE or UMAP would be better to show smaller or tighter groupings more clearly.\n",

        "In the PCA plot, I did see some points far from the rest. These could be outliers or off-topic news. In production, I’d use cosine distance from cluster centers or models like Isolation Forest to flag them and decide if they should be excluded or reviewed manually.\n",

        "K-means is simple and fast, but it assumes clusters are round and balanced. That’s not always the case with text. If the data is uneven or has noise, I’d go with DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering, especially when I don’t want to set a fixed number of clusters.\n",

        "The clusters may be clear in meaning, but not helpful for price prediction. For example, some news might already be expected by the market, or the tone wasn’t included. I’d add sentiment, volume, or macro indicators to get better predictions.\n",
